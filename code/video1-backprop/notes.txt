we'll go through building micrograd
micrograd is an autograd (automatic gradient) engine
it implements backpropagation
"backpropagation allows us to evaluate the gradient of a loss function with respect to the weights of a neural network"
    backprop is a way for a neural network to learn by figuring out how much each weight affects the error.
